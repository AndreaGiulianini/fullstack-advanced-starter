# Starter for SvelteKit - Typescript - NestJS - Prisma - Docker

Small project created test how some of the open source projects that most appeal to me lately work.

To start the project on Docker launch the file './start.bat' on windows, on other operating systems just copy paste the contents of the file

To populate the database container launch the file './reset_poste.bat'
